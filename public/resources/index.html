<p>A collection of enduring references on security, risk, and adversarial thinking. In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have no idea if anything we do actually works[<a href="https://magoo.medium.com/next50-ea33c5db5930">1</a>]. Measurement and root causes remain security&rsquo;s fundamental unsolved problem</li>
<li>The industry thinks training fixes people but research shows it makes things worse [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07498">2</a>]. Use passkeys/webauthn/yubikeys.</li>
<li>Most breaches don&rsquo;t matter for most orgs. [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA-OCE_Cost_of_Cyber_Incidents_Study-FINAL_508.pdf">3</a>] 85% fail to meet accounting materiality thresholds and the median cost-to-revenue ratio: 0.37%</li>
<li>Only 12% of patches matter for APT defense. But immediate patching = 4.9x lower compromise odds vs. 1 month delay. [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.07759">4</a>]</li>
<li>While useful, EDRs are fundamentally ineffective against actual APT actors[<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2624-800X/1/3/21">5</a>]</li>

Without knowledge of decision maker preferences, there is no risk. Kaplan-Garrick risk definition (eg what can go wrong, how likely, what consequences) is incomplete.

Information security industry is stalling due to lack of a &ldquo;measurement revolution&rdquo; comparable to meteorology&rsquo;s post-1950 transformation.

Incident costs have extreme variability with heavy-tailed distributions where the mean is a poor indicator. 85% of cyber incidents fail to meet financial materiality thresholds (of 2-10%). The median cost-to-revenue ratio across all sectors is only 0.37%. Per-record cost estimates are flawed because breach costs don&rsquo;t correlate strongly with breach size for large incidents.</li>

No evidence exists that phishing tests reduce successful phishing incidents. Traditional tests cause harmful side effects: they bypass systematic security controls, degrade trust between users and security teams, create incident response burden, and make employees feel &ldquo;tricked.&rdquo; Alternative: &ldquo;phishing fire drills&rdquo; - pre-announced training emails that clearly identify themselves, focusing on education and practicing reporting. Fix tools, not people - use phishing-resistant authenticators.</li>

Extrinsic rewards (money, bonuses) actually reduce performance for complex cognitive work.
