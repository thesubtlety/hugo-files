  <p>High Output Management by Andy Grove is the best management book I’ve read. It is also the only one, but I don’t think that matters; it’s a classic for a reason. Written before I was born, the advice is timeless even if some of the terms aren’t. I had to look up what a “tickler” file was (a low tech reminder system).</p>
<p>Your job as a manager starts to make more sense if you change your thinking to consider how you and your team can be leveraged, i.e. making your team more effective. Prior experience leaves me realizing many managers don&rsquo;t think in this way.</p>

  <p>During a recent red team engagement I was looking into options for VB macro execution on MacOS. The enterprise system I was investigating had Adobe Acrobat installed along with Microsoft Office integrations basically adding an Adobe tab to Word and Excel to convert documents to PDF.</p>
<p>On whim, I decided to take a look at how this might be working, and started poking around the file system. Turns out Adobe installs an AppleScript file to <code>~/Library/Application Scripts/com.microsoft.{Word,Excel,Powerpoint}/AcrobatUtils.scpt</code>.</p>

  <time datetime="2020-10-21T19:44:32-0700" class="post-date">Wed, Oct 21, 2020</time>
  <p>If an unwitting user runs a malicious macro-enabled document on a macOS system that has Sublime Text installed, an attacker can seamlessly escape the Office sandbox.</p>
<p>In effect</p>
<ol>
<li>The MS Office sandbox allows writing files to arbitrary locations as long as they begin with <code>~$</code>, with some exceptions</li>
<li>The Sublime Text editor automatically loads (outside the sandbox) Python plugins from a user writable file path</li>
</ol>
<p>After reading Patrick Wardle&rsquo;s <a href="https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x4B.html">Office Drama on macOS</a> which outlined a persistence method leveraging a sandbox escaped discovered by Adam Chester (see <a href="https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x35.html">Escaping the Microsoft Office Sandbox</a>), I did some rudimentary experimenting. Recent patches have precluded directly writing to <code>LaunchAgents</code> or <code>Application Scripts</code> but files can still be written to other user writable paths as long as they start with <code>~$</code>.</p>

  <p>Over the past few years I&rsquo;ve run into vulnerable Jenkins backups with anywhere from half a dozen to several hundred encrypted passwords, secrets, and keys to critical infrastructure. While there are a multitude of tools out there none of them behaved quite like I wanted, so I wrote my own and learned some Golang in the process.</p>
<p>The tool isn&rsquo;t groundbreaking but it does do something I haven&rsquo;t seen available else where, and that is the ability to decrypt files encrypted with Jenkins&rsquo;  <code>SecretBytes</code> implementation offline - not using the Groovy console.</p>

  <p>There&rsquo;s not a lot written about creating new <a href="https://hashcat.net/hashcat/">Hashcat</a> modules. This is a brief tour of how I went about adding a new module and something I wish I had available a week ago. Hopefully after reading this you have a better understanding of how the pieces work and will enable you to more easily add new Hashcat modules.</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, this is written from the perspective of someone who care barely read C. And while I refer to OpenCL a few times, if your crypto primitives aren&rsquo;t supported already, this article probably won&rsquo;t help you.</p>

  <time datetime="2019-12-10T18:07:57-0800" class="post-date">Tue, Dec 10, 2019</time>
  <p>This is a quick post mostly for refreshing my memory in the future. I recently wanted to download the data Shodan had on a large corporate IP space with disparate ranges and several hundred thousand IP addresses for post processing.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell the Shodan help docs are scattered across too many pages and domains and subdomains. There are a few guides out there on the basics of Shodan CLI and API but I didn&rsquo;t see anything that documented things at a slightly larger scale so here are a few quick notes on gathering this data. Shodan needs no introduction, and the basics are well covered so I&rsquo;ll dive in.</p>

  <time datetime="2019-09-23T20:52:14-0700" class="post-date">Mon, Sep 23, 2019</time>
  <p>Several times now I&rsquo;ve run across password hashes created by <a href="https://directory.fedoraproject.org/">389-ds</a>, RedHat&rsquo;s open source LDAP Directory Server solution. During a red team past operation I discovered a backup <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDAP_Data_Interchange_Format">LDIF file</a> which included hashed user passwords (think NTDS.dit but not as catastrophic). A number of the hashes were in prepended with <code>PBKDF2_SHA256</code>.</p>
<p>While hashcat and john the ripper have support for most algorithms, they are at the moment lacking support for 389-ds&rsquo;s <code>PBKDF2_SHA256</code> implementation. And as far as I can tell, nothing currently exists to easily verify or check passwords against these hashes. Base64 decoding the hashes I discovered didn&rsquo;t immediately point to quick solutions either. But 389-ds is open source, so when you need to crack passwords, the source is good place to turn.</p>

  <p>A while back I was playing around with Empire (before it was shuttered, RIP) and bypassing a certain antivirus software. There were decent signatures for the basic powershell usage, but knowing Python was installed on the target Windows endpoints, I tried to run the Empire Python payload on Windows. It didn&rsquo;t work. Turns out, it&rsquo;s trivial to get things working again.</p>
<p>If you generate a basic Python stager with stock Empire, we see an initial checkin to the server</p>

  <p>I was recently doing some testing in AWS with some &ldquo;obtained&rdquo; access keys. Part of this engagement was to identify some threshold at which the blue team was noticing and engaging with suspicious activity and as such we were running some automated tooling. In AWS this can mean bruteforcing services and creating quite a bit of logs.</p>
<p>After not so long we got a request asking if we were up to anything - success! Blue had noticed something was up! But to be honest, I hadn&rsquo;t expected them to be on to us so quickly. And when we debriefed we discovered Amazon GuardDuty had alerted that someone was making requests from Kali (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_pentest.html"><code>PenTest:IAMUser/KaliLinux</code></a>). This feature was released late December, 2018. Now how did GuardDuty know this? Their documentation states the following.</p>

I like Jenkins. It&rsquo;s a good orchestration tool and provides remote code execution as a service.</p>
<p>If your user permissions give you access to the script console <code>/script</code> it&rsquo;s trivial to obtain a shell. The developers explicitly call this out in their <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+Script+Console">documentation</a> as well so it&rsquo;s a feature, not a bug.  Of course if you can create a job you can run shell commands as well, but I&rsquo;ll leave that for another time.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t just register for the CTP - you need to solve a small challenge first: <a href="http://fc4.me/">http://fc4.me/</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any shame in not being able to complete this. It simply means you&rsquo;re not ready&hellip; yet! If you look up the solution online, you&rsquo;re just cheating yourself and wasting both time and money. It&rsquo;s been put there for a reason.

  <p>Recon is close to <a href="http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Intelligence_Gathering">step one</a> in any pentest. When it comes to passively pulling data on infrastructure assets you have a number of options. <a href="https://whois.arin.net/ui/advanced.jsp">ARIN</a> can help identify an organization&rsquo;s registered net blocks, but that&rsquo;s only part of the picture. With many organizations based in or using cloud services, those assets won&rsquo;t necessarily be registered to your target.</p>
<p>And when AWS for example can tie <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/">directly into a datacenter</a>, these servers become quite valuable. As an aside to AWS, check out <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/33c3-7865-gone_in_60_milliseconds">Gone in 60 Milliseconds</a> by <a href="https://github.com/Miserlou">Rich Jones</a> - awesome talk. Now if a developer stands up a server with HTTPS using a corporate certificate it&rsquo;s likely going to be picked up and indexed by someone, Shodan, or Censys - so let&rsquo;s make use of that.</p>

  <p>Occasionally an environment has strict outbound rules with all traffic going through an authenticated proxy. This hampers exfiltration, especially if you don&rsquo;t currently have valid credentials but need a foothold into an environment without phishing for instance. If we can find a live network jack in some accessible place and the switch hands out an IP address via DHCP along with DNS servers, we can more than likely obtain a foothold into the network.</p>

  <p>I came across OpenDNS Security Ninjas AppSec <a href="https://github.com/opendns/Security_Ninjas_AppSec_Training">Training Lab</a> not too long ago and found its simplicity rather enjoyable. It&rsquo;s a simple web app written in PHP which illustrates each of the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Table_of_Contents">OWASP Top 10</a> categories. As I was going through the exercises I found myself checking to see how the vulnerable code was written and how the issues could be remediated.</p>
<p>Since the lab is geared towards beginners, I thought it might be helpful to provide brief explanations along with links to the relevant lines of source code. For each level/OWASP vulnerability, I simply added a &ldquo;Why&rdquo; section to each &ldquo;Solution&rdquo; area linking to the sink on Github along with a brief explanation.</p>

  <p>A brilliant <a href="http://blaedj.github.io/">software engineering friend</a> and I were recently discussing with another mutual friend the inefficiencies of employees filling out paper forms after completion of a construction job and the inefficiencies of transferring said forms to excel and so on. Said friend and I figured we could probably fix this with a web app for a nominal fee, but which would greatly increase our mutual friends&rsquo; productivity. A win win situation if there ever was one.</p>

  <p>Since I&rsquo;ve forgotten how to do this over the past year, here are the directions for posterity.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Startcom sends you a reminder after 50 weeks and opens a window for a renewal. Log in and validate your email and domain using the Validation Wizard. Note, you need to ensure your email is going to forward properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generate a key and CSR on the server with the following two commands
<code>openssl genrsa -out ./www.thesubtlety.com.key 2048</code> 
<code>openssl req -new -key www.thesubtlety.com.key -out www.thesubtlety.com.csr</code></p>

  <p>Things have been busy lately, but I&rsquo;ve been doing some reading, learning, and playing around in a small VM lab, and thought to briefly document what I&rsquo;ve done. There is unfortunately nothing groundbreaking here, and nothing too interesting beyond a demonstration.</p>
<pre><code>___  ___       _                      _         _  _

                              |_|
</code></pre>
<p>For this example I&rsquo;ve got Kali Linux, Metasploitable, Windows XP SP2, and Security Onion running. (Time to add some RAM&hellip;) There are a ton of good reference resources out there, and most of this is simply plug and play. The Kali distro isn&rsquo;t packaged with <a href="http://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/select-your-operating-system">Nessus</a>, so that may need downloaded and installed, although certainly not required for our purposes. Nothing fancy here as all machines are on the same subnet and bridged via my host NIC, making traffic sniffing trivial and allowing us to see the (mostly Snort rule) results of this nefarious-ness.</p>

  <time datetime="2013-10-29T01:19:19Z" class="post-date">Tue, Oct 29, 2013</time>
  <p>I recently attended my first security conference: BSidesDC. This isn&rsquo;t a write up of that experience, although it was quite interesting and I learned a lot via some great sessions. One talk I really enjoyed by <a href="https://twitter.com/grecs">@grecs</a> was <a href="https://www.novainfosec.com/2013/10/19/malware-analysis-slides-from-bsidesdc/">Malware Analysis 101</a>. Very well presented with lots of great getting started material.</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.thesubtlety.com/img/bsides-150x150.jpg">
</figure>

<p>Anyways, the badges. Pretty cool badges; bottle openers in fact, with fourteen binary bytes all with leading zeroes around the circumference: ascii encoded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code">binary</a>. The message is trivially found via google, but where&rsquo;s the fun in that? And wanting to play around with Python some more I decided to write something that could decode the binary. My first stab looks like this.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve played around with <a href="http://securityonion.blogspot.com/">Security Onion</a> in the past, but have never set up my network to capture or monitor traffic. And while installing Security Onion in a VM and only looking at only local or inter-VM traffic is quite interesting, especially if a person is playing around with Metasploit or something, I wanted to see all network traffic, including my other devices. I also had a laptop lying around, not being frequently used; perfect for dedicated monitoring. So I finally got around to working through the details and going through the setup and configuration. This is a little essay on how I did that.</p>

  <p>I recently bought a Raspberry Pi and installed <a href="http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv6/raspberry-pi#qt-platform_tabs-ui-tabs2">Arch Linux ARM</a> on it. I came across a rather amusing blog post of someone using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)">honeypot</a> <a href="https://code.google.com/p/kippo/">Kippo</a> and thought what fun. See <a href="http://www.iwatchedyourhack.org/">here</a> to watch elite hackers and their mad skillz. That&rsquo;s the great thing about Kippo - it records user sessions for playback.</p>
<p>Anyways, this post basically walks through what I did to get Kippo and <a href="http://bruteforce.gr/kippo-graph">kippo-graph</a> up and running on my RPi. This isn&rsquo;t a walk-you-through-every-step guide, so if you&rsquo;re following along your mileage may vary. Of course, the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/kippo/w/list">Wiki pages</a> over on Google Code are a good place to start. Or <a href="http://bruteforce.gr/installing-kippo-ssh-honeypot-on-ubuntu.html">here</a>. Or <a href="http://www.ctrl-alt-del.cc/2010/07/making-new-friends-with-kippo.html">here</a>.

  <p>I was fortunate enough to get a good job in IT right out of college. Not in InfoSec, but in telecom, and in specific, service delivery. I&rsquo;m learning an incredible amount - from enterprise telephony environment to working in a highly complex work environment to leading delivery on new intent projects. But it&rsquo;s not InfoSec.</p>
<p>In my search for ways to break into InfoSec, I&rsquo;ve come across numerous <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/07/how_to_become_a_1.html">posts</a>, <a href="http://pauldotcom.com/2009/05/getting-started-in-information.html">advice</a>, and <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/how-to-break-into-security/">tips</a> to do just that. And this is great stuff - I&rsquo;m working on the learning and the doing covered in those posts. But I really enjoyed the clear, common sense advice on building a  resume, the job search, interview techniques, brand building, and general career advice given by Rob Fuller.

  <p>The other day I came across an article by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_J._Ranum">Marcus J Ranum</a> on <a href="http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/index.html">the six dumbest ideas in computer security</a> which were very simple yet struck me as profound. I&rsquo;ll summarize them here for future reference.</p>
<ol>
<li>Default Permit</li>
</ol>
<p>Back when computer networks were still in their infancy, there were few avenues for attack. With those avenues turned off, all else was allowed. Hence &ldquo;default permit.&rdquo; Another area is code execution: anything clicked is permitted to run, unless stopped by antivirus or the likes. The proper solution here is default deny, but this, according to Ranum, takes dedication, thought, and understanding, and so is seldom done. And it allows one to sleep better at night.</p>

Performing only 12% of all possible updates - only patching publicly known vulnerabilities exploited in documented APT campaigns wouldn&rsquo;t significantly change compromise odds compared to organizations updating for all versions. Update immediately faces 4.9x lower odds of compromise than those waiting one month and 9.1x lower than those waiting three months.</li>

Extrinsic rewards (money, bonuses) actually reduce performance for complex cognitive work. Autonomy-Mastery-Purpose (AMP) shows that for complex work requiring creativity, the key is to &ldquo;pay enough to take the issue of money off the table&rdquo; then motivate through autonomy (control over time/technique), mastery (progress at meaningful skills), and purpose (contribution to mission larger than self).</li>
