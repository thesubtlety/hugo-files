I am a security professional with over five years of experience having held roles troubleshooting
networks and securing applications. I have been red teaming at a large company for the past several years.

I have a strong track record of applying creative thinking and determination to solve technical challenges.
I contribute to open source software including the Metasploit framework<sup>1</sup> and enjoy sharing my
technical learning experiences through this blog. I hold a few certificates including the OSCE and OSCP.

I'm always interested in challenging new opportunities.
