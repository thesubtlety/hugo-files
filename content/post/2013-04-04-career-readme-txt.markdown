I read this [article](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer) by Patrick McKenzie a while back, came across it again, and decided it's worth reading weekly. I've pulled out some of his bolded points. But seriously, read the article in it's entirety. Again. And again.

**Don't Call Yourself a Programmer, And Other Career Advice**



	
  * Modesty is not a career enhancing character trait

	
  * Network. In person.

	
  * Learn how to negotiate

	
  * Get good at Enterprise Sales

	
  * Most jobs are never available publicly

	
  * You really want to be attached to Profit Centers

	
  * Describe yourself by what you have accomplished for previous employers vis-a-vis increasing revenues or reducing costs

	
  * You radically overestimate the average skill of the competition because of the crowd you hang around with

	
  * I like this one: Business decisions are made by relatives of chimps, not by rules or algorithms

	
  * Your most important skill is communication. Give the perception that you create value

	
  * People who are skilled in negotiation make more than those who are not

	
  * Engineers are hired to create business value, not to program things

	
  * Happiness will not be dominated by your career. Work to live.
