High Output Management by Andy Grove is the best management book I’ve read. It is also the only one, but I don’t think that matters; it’s a classic for a reason. Written before I was born, the advice is timeless even if some of the terms aren’t. I had to look up what a “tickler” file was (a low tech reminder system).

Your job as a manager starts to make more sense if you change your thinking to consider how you and your team can be leveraged, i.e. making your team more effective. Prior experience leaves me realizing many managers don't think in this way.

**What is a manager’s job?**

- The output of a manager is the output of his organization and those under his influence
- Applying **leverage** gets the most value out of a manager, e.g. review output early, spot check work, monitor the decision making process

**On Working**

- Knowledge work forecasting can be done with the calendar
    - fill in holes between time-critical events with non-time-critical
    - say no to work earlier than later
    - allow slack
- Managers should carry an inventory of discretionary projects in addition to reactionary work
- Managers must add value. Are they doing anything with the group? Training? Hiring? Improving the group’s output?

**On Taking Notes**

- The output of reports and plans are much less important than the process of creating them.
- Take notes always - you may never refer to them, but writing things down force you to think about and categorize info

**On Planning**

What is the current environment? 

- Customer perception, technological changes, vendor performance

What is the environment in 2 years?

- What will customers expect, what tech will exist/change, how will vendors change?

The present status?

- List capabilities and current work
- What is in process, what percentage don’t complete the process?

How to close the gap?

- What do you need vs what can you do to close the gap to determine strategy - What you do to implement a strategy are tactics. Strategy at one level is another level’s tactics
- What are you doing today to solve or avoid tomorrow’s problems?

**On Decisions**

Before decision making processes occur, determine the following

- what decision needs made
- when does it need made by
- who will decide it
- who needs consulted prior to making decision
- who will ratify or veto the decision
- who needs informed of the decision

**On Results**

- Management by Objectives (MBO)
    1. Where do I want to go? (Objective)
    2. How will I pace myself to see if I’m getting there? (Milestones/Key Results)
- Culture should value and emphasize output, not knowledge. Creating tangible output should be valued and rewarded
- Objectives should be set so that after pushing hard there’s only a 50/50% chance of achieving
- The responsibility for teaching subordinates is on the supervisor, and mistakes shouldn’t be learned or paid for by internal or external customers

**On Training**

- One of the highest leverage activities for a manager - if you can improve 10 people’s output by 1% over a year you gain about 200 hours of work
- It is a continuous process, not a one off event, and training should occur at all levels
- How? set a schedule with deadlines, create an outline for the whole course, and develop the first lecture. After presenting, iterate - there’s no way it’ll be perfect the first time.

**Management Styles**

- As a subordinate moves from low familiarity to high with a given role or task, hands on management should be _inversely_ correlated.
- People with Low Familiarity get detailed instructions with when and how. Medium Familiarity get support, encouragement, communication. High Familiarity is primarily mutually agreed objectives and some monitoring. This is referred to as _task relevant maturity_.
- These can change as events dictate - new/novel situations or ones that require swift action may require immediate direction by managers.

**On one-on-ones**

- Should occur on the subordinates terms/office
- Subordinate should drive the agenda and outline which both people have access to
- Managers should be getting performance indicators, statuses, and potential problems
- Managers role is to learn and coach by asking one more question until both parties are satisfied
- Consider you’re coaching a high performance sports team - be tough, drive towards good performance

**On Performance Reviews**

- The ultimate purpose is to improve the subordinate’s performance. To highlight skills gaps and opportunities, and to increase motivation and performance
- They are not reserved for certain organizations but are useful in all organizations regardless of size
- When reviewing managers, consider whether output indicators are from previous managers, or the time offset between a manager’s work and the output of their organization.
- “The performance rating of a manager cannot be higher than the one we would accord his organization”. Performance over appearance.
- *Level* - be entirely frank. *Listen* - really understand if a message is being received, and continue until it is. *Leave yourself out* - don’t convey your own anxieties, guilt, emotions.
- Convey only major themes, not a list of everything you may have noticed. Your goal is to improve performance, nothing else.
- They should contain: job description, accomplishments, strengths, opportunities. Statements with examples, and illustrations of how to improve. Does not meet, meets, exceeds, superior.

**On Interviewing**

- It’s a crap shoot, but you’re trying to gauge technical knowledge about the specific role, and what they did with that knowledge, any discrepancies, and operational values
- Describe projects, weaknesses, what they achieved, failed, what did they learn, problems, why are you ready for this job, why should company hire you


## Measurement

Grove even provides a scoring mechanism to guide your activities.
