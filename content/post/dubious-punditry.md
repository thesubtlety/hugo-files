NB: This is all armchair punditry, the words of whose ilk are typically dubious. And I'm unqualified to say most all of this, but this is the internet. And here we are.

I would encourage red teams and blue teams alike to question the internal/external providers they use on how they are performing threat replication and whether they are truly replicating the multifaceted aspects involved with an adversary

Maybe the Red Team and Offensive Security industry has matured past this point in the past five years.

The thought that red teams should only simulate adversaries is limiting. Some organizations may want to know if they're vulnerable to a specific threat group using the same tactics they've used before, but arguably most don't. Not to mention a threat groups tactics evolve.

An APT is literally the instantiation of a nation stateâ€™s will. It is not a toolchain.

A Red Team (either consultant or internal) is the instantiation of an organization's desire to answer business risk questions
A cyber crime group is the intsantiation of an individual(s) to obtain funds, cause harm, or misjudgingly act out of curiosity

Within each group there are varying degrees of resources, sophistication, and capabilities.

An organization hiring a red team will pay for what it can afford. The more they pay, the higher the degree of business risk assurance.

Actor's resources, sophistication, and capabilities will vary regardless of the group they belong to. 

Elite groups are certainly using sophisticated techniques rarely practiced by those on the lawful side. Look at Turla.

Compromise occurs simply by people who are incentivised to achieve a goal against a victim. The means vary. 

These are all just people. Their resources vary, their sophisitication varies, as well as their capabilities. But the means remain the same - typically abusing shared technology.

How their work and research is comes to light does vary.

Red Teams have career incentives to publish their research and work. Leads to increased visibilty, earnings potential, visiblity for employer. Research often considered to have been discovered independently. multiple cases of this.

Criminal activity obviously isn't "published" other than if it's obtained somehow -  antivirus and edr products and honey pots, virustotal and malware analysis, or threat intel reports, maybe leaked.

APT groups aren't publishing but there have been high profile leaks from NSA toolkits via shadowbrokers and the CIA's Vault7 toolkits by Wikileaks. I have not seen public releases of other nation states which is curious. What about Russia, China, Israel?

Observers see these releases and toolkits and speak about the overstep and dangers of dual use technology. Inevitably leading to conversations of censorship.

But these capabilities are inevitable. 

Waasenar, arms control, policy, politics...


this is just another definition idea...
challenge assumptions
test system/control
test blue response
find systemic risk to focus defense/budge
