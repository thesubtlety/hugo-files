This blogging thing is harder than it seems - the what to write, the time to write. I came across another interesting blog post from [Krebs on Security](http://m.krebsonsecurity.com/2012/06/how-to-break-into-security-ptacek-edition/),  who interviewed Thomas Ptackek, founder of Matasano Security, on how to get into the field of computer security. As this is precisely my intent, I gave it a quick read through and thought to post a to-do for myself.



	
  1. Learn how to program. Plugging away with Ruby. Get dabbling in Python and C.

	
  2. Set up a home lab for experimenting_. Done._

	
  3. Install an old version of Wordpress on a VM.

	
  4. Use WebScarab or Burp Suite on your ancient Wordpress site.

	
  5. The best jobs in the field are in application security.

	
  6. Position yourself near custom software development or get a role in QA.

	
  7. Find opportunities to practice in your job.


This is exciting and encouraging! And because I'm already started on a couple of these things, I'm well on my way. Thanks Brian Krebs and Thomas Ptacek!

By the way, the [careers page](http://www.matasano.com/careers/) of Matasano security is awesome as far as what to expect when interviewing for a pen testing job.
