I was fortunate enough to get a good job in IT right out of college. Not in InfoSec, but in telecom, and in specific, service delivery. I'm learning an incredible amount - from enterprise telephony environment to working in a highly complex work environment to leading delivery on new intent projects. But it's not InfoSec.

In my search for ways to break into InfoSec, I've come across numerous [posts](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/07/how_to_become_a_1.html), [advice](http://pauldotcom.com/2009/05/getting-started-in-information.html), and [tips](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/how-to-break-into-security/) to do just that. And this is great stuff - I'm working on the learning and the doing covered in those posts. But I really enjoyed the clear, common sense advice on building a  resume, the job search, interview techniques, brand building, and general career advice given by Rob Fuller. Watch the presentation [here](http://vimeo.com/4108726). (About 50 minutes)
